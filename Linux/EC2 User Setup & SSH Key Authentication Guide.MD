## User Creation & Group Setup

```bash
sudo useradd kiran
sudo groupadd Devops
sudo usermod -g Devops kiran
````

---

## Password Configuration

```bash
sudo passwd kiran
```

---

## SSH Directory Setup & Permissions

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/kiran/.ssh
sudo chown -R kiran:Devops /home/kiran/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/kiran/.ssh
```

---

## Enabling SSH Password and Key Authentication

Edit the SSH config:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure the following lines are set:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Restart SSH and verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo sshd -t
```

---

## Generating SSH Keys

On the client or EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f remote
mv remote remote.pem
```

---

## Configuring Authorized Keys

```bash
cat remote.pub >> /home/kiran/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown kiran:Devops /home/kiran/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /home/kiran/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

## Logging In Using SSH Keys

```bash
ssh -i remote.pem kiran@<public-ip>
```

---

## Important Security Notes

* Replace `<public-ip>` with your EC2 instance’s public IP address.
* Keep private keys (`remote.pem`) secure and **never upload them publicly**.
* Use `.gitignore` to exclude private keys from your Git repository:

```gitignore
*.pem
*.key
```

---

*This guide ensures secure and effective user setup on EC2 instances, ideal for DevOps and cloud administration.*
